- ai detector sa image ✅✅

- feed posts algo (dapat mga related lang sa course ng user)✅✅

- view feed layout bug ✅✅

- pag onboarding/rejected, balik yung mga menu sa header, pero wala yung mga for companies, tanggalin din yung sidebar sa render. ✅✅

- /uploads puro 404? okay naman sakin.

- if user did not match the any course required on the job posts but he has 1 skill matched on the skills required, it will still be prioritize on top above the course matches. so the hierarchy of order is: ✅✅
  - amount of skills
  - course

- users can only react if active, if they clicked it and not active, there will be a modal shown depending on their status. example if onboarding, there will be a status saying you're still onboarding, please finish and etc.., if pending, you're account is still onboarding and you currently don't have access for etc..., same goes on for rejected companies... ✅✅ (Dinisable ko na lang react button)

- available posistions can't be negative. change this to input string and validate it with zod or allow it being 0 on input but validate when submit.

- job categories on the /company/post-job should be based on company's industry, refer to the industry_categories.json and since it's a long list, add a search feature. ✅✅

- job categories not getting displayed when selected. ✅✅

- on the /comapny/job-postings, there is an option for company on the applicant to view profile, if clicked, there will be a modal showing applicant's info. basically the same popup on the /admin/applicants when clicked the actions button. could make this a component for reusability. ✅✅

- sort button for company job postings.✅✅
  - Recently Updated (Default)
  - Date Posted: Newest/Oldest
  - Total Applcations
  - Job Title (A - Z)

- rejected job_posts should get a reason, same as rejected company.✅✅
- disabled has a reason, but company can't edit their job post to comply.

- on /applicant/application-tracker, applicants can't accept the offer on selected. it only works when they view full details on the application and accept it there.
- generate google link bug, probably sa env lang to, hope so. ✅✅

- If the admin wants to reject the company, a required input will appear to explain the cause of rejection. ✅✅
  - Addition of column will be on the `account` table. New column will be  an optional field named `account.rejected_reason`.  ✅✅
  - If rejected company logs in, it will be the same as onboarding where they can view the website but a message will show saying they are rejected and if they view the reason, it will show a popover content. ✅✅

- tanggalin na yung action ng admin to set the job post status ng filled.✅✅

- admin/applicant view lang, bawal edit ✅✅

- all time filter as default sa analytics ng admin, nag add din ako ng analytics sa job status ✅✅

- required hours when applying jobs should not accept 0

- change button when the applicant applied to the job

- shift of skeleton layout on /view/company/... ✅✅

- remove the required hours and preferred schedule on applicant onboarding, they can only set it on the profile ✅✅
- when applicant is applying for the job, auto fill the required hours and preferred schedule if they set it up on ther profile. ✅✅
